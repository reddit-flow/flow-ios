# flow-ios
Flow client for iOS.

Designed to be an alternative to the horrible *(official)* Reddit app. UI based mostly on Google's material design scheme.

# Things to know
* All sources (beta, pre-alpha, etc.) will be stored in their own branches. Nothing except screenshots and other non-essential items will be commited to the master branch.
* All releases will be stored in the *Releases*.


# Requirements
* Mac/Macbook with Xcode installed
* iOS development profile
* This project


# Instructions
* Download this project and save it in a local directory
* Navigate to the local directory and double-click the .xcworkspace file. Xcode will open and load all Cocoa pods included in the directory.
* Change iPhone Developer Certificate and use your own.
* Compile by using the build button in the main workspace.

# Current Project Progress

* 12/8/18: Uploaded mandatory files to allow app to compile successfully.
* 12/7/18: Development for landing screen started
* 12/6/18: Login scheme created and connected to Firebase
* 12/2/18: Development started

UI is quite messy right now. Only a few features work.
